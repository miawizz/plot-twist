      <h2>Here's How to Play Plot Twist!</h2>
      <p>Work together to make up a silly, creative, imaginative story by taking turns every few sentences.</p>
      <h3>Tips for Taking Turns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a "story stick" — any item around the house like a toy or even a spoon. Whoever holds the story stick gets to speak, then passes it to the next person.</li>
        <li>Or try saying "Popcorn!" and pointing to whoever's turn it is next to "pop" the story over to them.</li>
        <li>If playing with more than two people, establish the order before you start playing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whenever you need a little creative inspiration... say "PLOT TWIST!" and tap the button for an idea! You can tap as many times as you want... but... do your best to stick with whatever idea is given to you.</p>
