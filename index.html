      <h2>Here's How to Play Plot Twist!</h2>
      <p>Work together to make up a silly, creative, imaginative story by taking turns every few sentences.</p>
      <h3>Tips for Taking Turns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a "story stick" — any item around the house like a toy or even a spoon. Whoever holds the story stick gets to speak, then passes it to the next person.</li>
        <li>Or try saying "Popcorn!" and pointing to whoever's turn it is next to "pop" the story over to them.</li>
        <li>If playing with more than two people, establish the order before you start playing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whenever you need a little creative inspiration to move the story along or just want to shake things up,<br><br>
      say "PLOT TWIST!" and tap the button for an idea!<br><br>
      You can tap as many times as you want... but...<br><br>
      For a fun challenge, do your best to stick with whatever idea is given to you and find a creative way to work it into the story — even if it doesn't seem to make sense at first.<br><br>
      Happy storytelling!</p>
